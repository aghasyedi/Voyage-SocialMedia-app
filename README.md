# VOYAGE: A Secure Blockchain-Based Social Media Platform

## Overview

In today’s digital world, the growing concern over data privacy, security, and centralized control in various applications has made the need for decentralized solutions more pressing. This project introduces **VOYAGE**, a secure blockchain-based platform designed to address these challenges by leveraging cryptographic techniques and decentralized technologies. 

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: The platform utilizes blockchain to provide transparency, immutability, and trust in user interactions and transactions.
- **Data Integrity**: SHA-1 hashing ensures that the data stored is tamper-proof and verifiable.
- **File Protection**: User-uploaded files, including images, are encrypted using the Fernet algorithm for enhanced privacy.
- **Decentralized Control**: By employing smart contracts and the inherent decentralized nature of blockchain, VOYAGE provides a transparent and secure environment for users.
- **Secure Authentication**: Cryptographic methods are used for secure user registrations and profile management.
- **Privacy-Focused**: The platform places a high emphasis on securing user data and ensuring privacy through advanced encryption techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ensures transparency and immutability of user data and interactions.
- **SHA-1 Hashing**: For data integrity and secure storage of sensitive information.
- **Fernet Encryption**: A symmetric encryption algorithm used to secure user-uploaded files, such as images.
- **Web3**: To facilitate smooth interaction with the blockchain.
- **Flask**: Integrated for both frontend and backend functionalities.
- **Python**: Used for backend logic and database management.

## Security Features

- **Symmetric Encryption**: User-uploaded images and sensitive data are encrypted using the Fernet algorithm to ensure confidentiality.
- **SHA-1 Hashing**: Ensures that the data is secure and has not been altered.
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Smart contracts ensure that all transactions and user activities are tamper-proof and transparent.
